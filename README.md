- a visitor scrolling the homepage on ***multi*** should be able to easily browse and view live streams that are currently broadcasting so they can discover interesting content.
  
  -  The *homepage* should be called **Live Streams.**
  -  On the **Live Streams** page there should be a list of current live streams arranged in grid style as above
  -  Each live stream should display:
    - the streamer's username,
    - a thumbnail of the stream,
    - and the stream's title.

 - When i click on a live stream to view it.

   - The video player for the live stream should be easily accessible and user-friendly.
   - While watching a live stream, there should be buttons that offer the following options:
     -  like,
     -  comment
       - the comment button should open into a comment section for engagement with both streamer and other viewers 
     -  and share the stream.

 * User should easily be able to exit the live stream and return to the homepage or stream list with an 'X' button on the top-right of the screen.

 If a live stream ends while I'm watching, user should be notified once again with the option to like, share, and comment.


* a user profile page that doubles as a dashboard where they can create and view their streams:
